# Connected Vehicle Resource Manager
## Description

This application provides a website to manage resources associated with a Connected Vehicle project. The website provides a series of forms to enter and view resources such as participants, training courses, vehicles and devices that are part of the project. Graphs showing resource usage and device deployment are provided in the website. Role based access restrictions limit the visibility of data to specific user roles. 

The application consists of a website, a REST service and a backend database. The website and REST service are secured using ssl security. User login security is provided using the Auth0 identity platform.

```

**Step 2**: Start MySQL in a terminal

**Step 3**: Create the database in MySQL

```bash
mysql> create database cvpt;
```

**Step 4**: Create database tables with script

```bash
mysql> use cvpt;
mysql> source <project install location>/data/cvptdbcreate;
```

**Step 5**: Replace all instances of &lt;username&gt; and &lt;password&gt; the file cvrm/data/testData.loadData.cmd with your MySQL username and password. 
Replace the instances of &lt;db-username&gt; and &lt;db-password&gt; in the file cvrm/service/src/main/resources/application.properties with your MySQL username and password.
